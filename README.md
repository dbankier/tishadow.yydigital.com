You _don't_ need to know scala or play to contribute to the
documentation.

The content and layout of the sections on the website are generated 
from the markdown documents found in the `app/views/sections` directory

 * ordering of the sections is controlled by the numbered prefix
 * the name of each section is controlled by the rest of the file name
 * page side navigation is generated from the generated `h3` (`###`) tags 

**pull requests welcome :)**
