## TiShadow Website

This is the source code for http://tishadow.yydigital.com.

It is now written nodejs. 

The origin version was written in Scala using the [Play
Framework](http://www.playframework.com). You can still see it on the
play-version branch.


## Contributing Documentation

The content and layout of the sections on the website are generated 
from the markdown documents found in the `sections` directory

 * ordering of the sections is controlled by the numbered prefix
 * the name of each section is controlled by the rest of the file name
 * page side navigation is generated from the generated `h3` (`###`) tags 

**pull requests welcome :)**
